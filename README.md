# What's new in FRAME?

Discover the latest enhancements in FRAME, including:
1. The new `runtime` macro that allows for dynamic composition of runtime logic in an extensible and modular way
2. `derive_impl` that simplifies the process of implementing traits by providing sensible default behavior, reducing boilerplate code, and making it easier for developers to work with FRAME pallets
3. `feeless_if` that can be used to trigger transactions without requiring an existing account which can be useful for scenarios like onboarding new users or enabling lightweight interactions
4. The `tasks` API that a mechanism for scheduling and managing service work items
5. Parameters pallet that provides a central place to store and configure parameters
6. MBMs (Multi Block Migrations) that streamline the process of migrating data across multiple blocks
7. `TransactionExtension` that provides flexibility for implementing additional features beyond the standard transaction lifecycle

These improvements collectively enhance the flexibility, efficiency, and extensibility of FRAME-based runtimes, empowering developers to create robust and customizable decentralized applications.
